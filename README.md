# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) Project

This project focuses on the development of a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) utilizing CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The aim is to achieve picosecond-level random number generation, which is significantly faster than currently available market options. This QRNG has potential applications in quantum cryptography, computational simulations, and other areas requiring high-speed, high-entropy random numbers.

## Project Goals

- **Design and Develop a QRNG:** Leverage quantum dots to create a robust, high-speed QRNG capable of generating numbers every picosecond.
- **Explore Applications:** Investigate potential uses in quantum key distribution (QKD), secure communications, encryption for corporate phone calls, and advanced computational simulations.
- **Optimize Performance:** Focus on enhancing the speed and efficiency of the QRNG compared to existing solutions.

## Current Progress

- **3D Modeling and Prototyping:** Designed and currently 3D printing various models to optimize the QRNGâ€™s efficiency. Ongoing testing is being conducted to refine the design and achieve maximum performance.
- **Software Development:** Developing software to interpret the generated quantum random numbers and integrate them into practical applications, including cryptographic protocols and secure communications.

## Future Work

- **Prototyping:** Continue building and rigorously testing the QRNG hardware and software components to meet the desired specifications.
- **Optimization:** Further refine the design and software algorithms to achieve the targeted picosecond-level generation.
- **Documentation:** Provide detailed technical documentation and user guides.

## Possible Applications

- **Quantum Cryptography:** Secure communications through quantum key distribution (QKD).
- **Corporate Phone Call Encryption:** Enhance the security of corporate communications by integrating QRNG-based encryption for phone calls.
- **Computational Simulations:** Improve the accuracy and reliability of complex simulations that require high-entropy random numbers.
- **Secure Communications:** Applications in military, governmental, and corporate settings where data integrity and security are paramount.
