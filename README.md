# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) Project

This project focuses on the development of a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) utilizing CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The aim is to achieve picosecond-level random number generation, which is significantly faster than currently available market options. This QRNG has potential applications in quantum cryptography, computational simulations, and other areas requiring high-speed, high-entropy random numbers.

## Project Goals

- **Design and Develop a QRNG:** Leverage quantum dots to create a robust, high-speed QRNG capable of generating numbers every picosecond.
- **Explore Applications:** Investigate potential uses in quantum key distribution (QKD), secure communications, encryption for corporate phone calls, and advanced computational simulations.
- **Optimize Performance:** Focus on enhancing the speed and efficiency of the QRNG compared to existing solutions.

## 3D Models

The following 3D models have been created for the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) project:

- **[Alignment Tool](3D_Models/alignment_tool.scad):** A tool designed to ensure precise alignment of components within the QRNG system.
- **[Base Platform](3D_Models/base_platform.scad):** The foundational platform on which all other components of the QRNG are mounted.
- **[Cable Management Clip](3D_Models/cable_management_clip.scad):** A custom-designed clip to organize and secure cables within the QRNG assembly.
- **[Cooling Fan Mount](3D_Models/cooling_fan_mount.scad):** A mount for attaching a cooling fan to ensure optimal thermal management of the QRNG hardware.
- **[Laser Diode Mount](3D_Models/laser_diode_mount.scad):** A precision mount designed for the secure placement and alignment of the laser diode in the QRNG.
- **[Lattice Enclosure](3D_Models/lattice_enclosure.scad):** An enclosure with lattice structures to house sensitive components while allowing adequate airflow.
- **[Modular Enclosure](3D_Models/modular_enclosure.scad):** A modular, stackable enclosure that allows for easy expansion and customization of the QRNG setup.
- **[Quantum Dot Chamber](3D_Models/quantum_dot_chamber.scad):** The chamber designed to hold quantum dots, optimized for interaction with laser light.
- **[Sensor Slot Enclosure](3D_Models/sensor_slot_enclosure.scad):** An enclosure with dedicated slots for embedding sensors with adjustable mounting.
- **[Vented Enclosure](3D_Models/vented_enclosure.scad):** An enclosure designed with multi-directional vents for enhanced cooling and airflow.

## Current Progress

- **3D Modeling and Prototyping:** All essential components have been designed and 3D printed. Ongoing testing is being conducted to refine the design and achieve maximum performance.
- **Software Development:** Developing software to interpret the generated quantum random numbers and integrate them into practical applications, including cryptographic protocols and secure communications.

## Future Work

- **Prototyping:** Continue building and rigorously testing the QRNG hardware and software components to meet the desired specifications.
